# rdwk: Roadwork - Backup software

Everybody has his own backup solution.
Why should I be any different?

## To Do

* `rsync` files to central host
* `find | cpio | gpg` files on central host to archive and encrypt the files on the central host
* store encrypted archive on an extrernal USB harddisk and store the USB hardisk on a remote location
* (optinal) store encrypted archive on a remote host
